How to secure your Development Code with Another Software . 

I am just talking about GitHub and Git  

Before this post we have only Basic idea about Git control version but I have worked on last few days at Git Advanced 

which I will share with you... 

In this post 


GitHub:
GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. 
It provides a cloud-based platform for developers to host and collaborate on Git repositories. 

Git:
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) designed for tracking changes in source code during software development. 

It provides commands like git init, git add, git commit, git push, git pull, git merge


Here Mention How to connect with GitHub account for uploading development code and managed team worked . 

1. Create Account :- 
https://github.com/ ( Singup with Google ) 

2. After Created Account click your profile as top right side  and click ( your repositories )

3. Add Repository name ( like development ) with public or private then click create repository

4.

To add new changes from your local repository to the main repository on GitHub, you'll need to follow these steps:

Ensure you're on the correct branch (usually 'main' or 'master'):
Copygit checkout main

Pull the latest changes from the remote repository:
Copygit pull origin main

Stage your changes:
Copygit add .
(This adds all changes. To add specific files, replace '.' with the file names)
Commit your changes:
Copygit commit -m "Your commit message describing the changes"

Push your changes to the remote repository:
Copygit push origin main


If you're working on a feature branch:

Commit your changes on your feature branch:
Copygit add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"

Switch to the main branch:
Copygit checkout main

Pull the latest changes:
Copygit pull origin main

Merge your feature branch:
Copygit merge your-feature-branch

Push to the remote repository:
Copygit push origin main


If you're not the owner of the main repository:

Fork the main repository on GitHub.
Clone your fork locally.
Make your changes, commit them.
Push to your fork.
Create a pull request on GitHub from your fork to the main repository.

Remember to always pull the latest changes before pushing to avoid conflicts. If there are conflicts, you'll need to resolve them before pushing. CopyRetryClaude does no
